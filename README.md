# What does this project demonstrate?

I successfully deployed this simple Node.js server to a cloud-based Kubernetes cluster.

Using Docker, I containerized the app, pushed the Docker image to Docker Hub which made it accessible to the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

Then, in AKS, I created a cluster and deployed my app, scaling it effortlessly.

Finally, I exposed it to the internet with a LoadBalancer, which provided an external IP to access the app.

The result? A fully functional web application, accessible globally, demonstrating my skills in cloud-native technologies and container orchestration with Kubernetes.
